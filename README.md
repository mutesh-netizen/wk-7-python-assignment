# Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

## Overview

This project demonstrates loading, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset using Python’s pandas and matplotlib libraries. The goal is to gain insights into the data through statistical summaries and various types of plots.

The classic **Iris dataset** is used here for demonstration, showcasing how to perform basic data analysis and create meaningful visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `analysis.ipynb` or `analysis.py`: Contains the Python code for data loading, exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

---

## Features

- Load dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Display initial rows to inspect data.
- Check data types and missing values.
- Perform basic statistical analysis using `.describe()`.
- Group data by categorical columns and calculate summary statistics.
- Create multiple types of visualizations:
  - Line chart (trend over samples).
  - Bar chart (comparison of averages across categories).
  - Histogram (distribution of a numerical column).
  - Scatter plot (relationship between two numerical columns).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for loading Iris dataset)

You can install required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
````

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `analysis.ipynb` or run the Python script `analysis.py`.
3. Follow the code cells or script to see the outputs and plots.
4. Review the statistical summaries and visualizations for insights.

## Insights and Observations

* The Iris dataset contains three species with varying sepal and petal dimensions.
* Species ‘setosa’ generally has smaller petal and sepal sizes.
* Visualizations help reveal patterns and differences between species.

---

## Error Handling

* The code includes basic error handling for file loading and data operations.
* Ensures the program does not crash on common issues like missing files.
